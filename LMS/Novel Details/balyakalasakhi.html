            <p>The childhood romance between neighbours blossoms into passionate love during adolescence. 
                The first half of the story, dealing with childhood and adolescence is pleasant, delightfully 
                told. The latter half is grim and filled with sorrow. Yet, it tells about the hope that people 
                living in near poverty have about their future. They accumulate their dreams and keep their 
                most secret sweet desires to themselves and go on with the hard grind of daily life, 
                struggling to eke out a living.</p>

            <p>The lightness of narrative style disguises an undercurrent of poignancy. 
                Even in the moments of utter grief, the author cannot let go of humour. 
                Intense tragedy is dished out as if it were something meant to make the readers laugh.</p>
