            <p>The Oath of the Vayuputras is the third book of Amish Tripathi, third book of Amishverse, 
                and also the third book of Shiva Trilogy. Starting from where the previous installment left off,
                Shiva discovers what is the true evil in The Oath of the Vayuputras. Shiva then declares a 
                holy war on those who seek to continue to use it, mainly the Emperors Daksha and Dilipa, 
                who are being controlled by the sage Bhrigu. The battle rages on and Shiva travels to the 
                land of Pariha to consult with Vayuputras, a legendary tribe. By the time he returns, 
                the war has ended with Sati, his wife, being murdered. An enraged Shiva destroys the capital 
                of Meluha and Somras is wiped out of history. The story concludes with Shiva and his 
                associates being popularized as Gods for their deeds and accomplishments.</p>
