            <p>The story concerns Anne Elliot, an Englishwoman of 27 years, whose family moves to lower 
                their expenses and reduce their debt by renting their home to an admiral and his wife. 
                The wife's brother, Captain Frederick Wentworth, was engaged to Anne in 1806, but the 
                engagement was broken when Anne was persuaded by her friends and family to end their 
                relationship. Anne and Captain Wentworth, both single and unattached, meet again after 
                a separation lasting almost eight years, setting the scene for a second, well-considered 
                chance at love and marriage for Anne.</p>
