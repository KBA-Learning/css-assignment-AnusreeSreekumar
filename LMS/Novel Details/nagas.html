            <p>The Secret of the Nagas is the second book of Amish Tripathi, second book of Amishverse, 
                and also the second book of Shiva Trilogy. The story takes place in the imaginary land of 
                Meluha and narrates how the inhabitants of that land are saved from their wars by a nomad 
                named Shiva. It begins from where its predecessor, The Immortals of Meluha, left off, 
                with Shiva trying to save Sati from the invading Naga. Later Shiva takes his troop of 
                soldiers and travels far east to the land of Branga, where he wishes to find a clue to 
                reach the Naga people. Shiva also learns that Sati's first child is still alive, as well 
                as her twin sister. His journey ultimately leads him to the Naga capital of Panchavati, 
                where he finds a surprise waiting for him.</p>
